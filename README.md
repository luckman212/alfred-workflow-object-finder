## Workflow Object Note Finder

This is a working POC, inspired by [this forum post](https://www.alfredforum.com/topic/22718-how-to-make-objects-in-workflows-searchable-via-in-alfred-bar/).

To use it, simply activate the trigger keyword and type a search query (matching is case-insensitive). If any results are found, they can be actioned to reveal and highlight the objects directly in Alfred Preferences.

**N.B.** The workflow requires `jq` (it will be auto-installed if you have Homebrew)
